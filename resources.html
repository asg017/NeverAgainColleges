          <h2 class="ui header">What is #NeverAgainColleges Resources?</h2>
            
            <p>#NeverAgainColleges Resources will be a resource that high school students who
            were main coordinators in creating #NeverAgain demonstrations in their communities
            can use to aid them in the college admissions process.</p>
            
            <p>For example, a student will be able to find people willing to edit their 
            college admissions essays, or look over their Common App, or just general academic and 
            career advice to help them succeed in the college admissions process. 
            </p>

          <div class="ui segment">
            <h2 class="ui header">Why is this needed?</h2>
            <p>#NeverAgainColleges Resources will provide a way young high school activists 
            to easily navigate the complicated and intense world of college admissions. It also
            allows for people in the college admissions
            industry to give back to the #NeverAgain movement by providing their expertise to 
            people that need it the most.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="ui segment">
            <h2 class="ui header">What type of help will be needed?</h2>
            <p>In general, I am thinking students would need help with:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>College Essays - Ideas, editing, proofreading</li>
              <li>College Choice - Finding colleges and universities that are a right fit</li>
              <li>Academic and Carrer Advice - Giving tips, tricks, and information about different academic fields and career paths.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="ui segment">
            <h2 class="ui header">How would the selection process work?</h2>
            <p>This entire project is still a work in progress. However, I'm thinking it would be something like:</p>
            
            <ol>
              <li>A (verified) high school student who coordinated a #NeverAgain demonstration
               in their community would make a request from #NeverAgainColleges Resources. </li>
               <li>#NeverAgainColleges Resources would contact volunteers, and ask if they have
               the time/expertise to help the student.</li>
               <li>Once confirmed, the volunteer and the high school student would be put in contact,
               with clear rules on what type of help is/isn't allowed.</li>
            </ol>
          </div>
          <div class="ui segment">
            <h2 class="ui header">How can I help?</h2>

          </div>
          <div class="ui segment">
            <h2 class="ui header">As a volunteer, how is my information protected?</h2>
            <p>The only people with access to your contact info will only be the #NeverAgainColleges team.
            That contact info is only shared with a high school student when you make clear and explicit
            consent to give it out, after the #NeverAgainColleges team shares with you the profile and 
            needs of the high school student.</p>
