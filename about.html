        <div class="ui segment">
          #NeverAgain Colleges serves two main purposes:
          
          <ol class="ui list">
            <li>Serve as real-time resource for universities that have publically supported participants in #NeverAgain movements.</li>
            <li>Encourage people to find and call on universities that have not put out statements yet.</li>
          </ol>
          
          
        </div>
        
        <h2 class="ui header">Methodology</h2>
        <div class="ui segment">
          A <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1J2R1ABpUoFSC3USeOOv5kpmyA7Ilw1D3aFinc1pW0yg">master spreadsheet</a> 
          is being maintained that serves as a real-time feed of universities that have put out public statements 
          supporting current or potential prospective students who engage in peaceful demonstrations. 
          There is a completed list of universities who have put out statements (along with a link to 
          their blog/tweet), and a list of universities who have not (put in manually). 
          Most of the data/statements has been provided by Chris Peterson of MIT, 
          who has kept an <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EwaBE6-CdqN-AA1srviRoOxwZ7lOcLd-EtCU0DiqUh8/edit">extensive up-to-date list of schools/statements</a> in the past few days 
          (<a href="https://www.nacacnet.org/news--publications/student-activism-and-the-admission-process/">NACAC has one as well</a>).
          
          <br>
          
          This website is a completely static website (hosted on Github Pages) that interacts
          with the master spreadsheet through an old Google Sheets API. <a href="https://semantic-ui.com">Semantic UI</a>
          us used to make it look pretty.

        <h2 class="ui header">Author</h2>
        <div class="ui segment">
          My name is Alex Garcia, I'm a third-year Computer Engineering major at UC San Diego, originally from Whittier CA.
          I made this tool because college admissions is a giant part of my life (currently work as a College
          Ambassador at my university), and I'm a frequent user of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/">r/ApplyingToCollege</a>.
          I also fully support the #NeverAgain movement, and want to see it accomplish great things in this country.
          I thought a tool like this would be useful to some people, so I made it.
