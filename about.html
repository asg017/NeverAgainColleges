        <h2 class="ui header">Purpose</h2>
          #NeverAgain Colleges serves two main purposes:
          
          <ol class="ui list">
            <li>Serve as real-time resource for universities that have publically supported participants in #NeverAgain movements.</li>
            <li>Encourage people to find and call on universities that have not put out statements yet.</li>
          </ol>
          
          <br>
          
          High schools students want to demonstrate as part of the #NeverAgain movement, but
          they fear discipline from their school administrators. For some of them, they fear
          that any sort of disciplinary actions from their current schools will effect any current 
          or potential admission to a university of their choice. By speaking out and putting out 
          statements, university admission offices have the power to reassure their applicants and 
          encourage their applicants to respectfully and peacefully perform their civic duty.

          <h2 class="ui header">Methodology</h2>
          
          A <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1J2R1ABpUoFSC3USeOOv5kpmyA7Ilw1D3aFinc1pW0yg">master spreadsheet</a> 
          is being maintained that serves as a real-time feed of universities that have put out public statements 
          supporting current or potential prospective students who engage in peaceful demonstrations. 
          There is a completed list of universities who have put out statements (along with a link to 
          their blog/tweet), and a list of universities who have not (put in manually). 
          Most of the data/statements has been provided by Chris Peterson of MIT, 
          who has kept an <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EwaBE6-CdqN-AA1srviRoOxwZ7lOcLd-EtCU0DiqUh8/edit">extensive up-to-date list of schools/statements</a> in the past few days 
          (<a href="https://www.nacacnet.org/news--publications/student-activism-and-the-admission-process/">NACAC has one as well</a>).

          This website is a completely static website (hosted on Github Pages) that interacts
          with the master spreadsheet through an old Google Sheets API. <a href="https://semantic-ui.com">Semantic UI</a>
          us used to make it look pretty.

          <h2 class="ui header">FAQ</h2>
            <h4 class="ui header">Would applicants really get there admittance rescinded for disciplinary actions from their high school?</h4>
              <p>Yes - depending on the rule violation and the university in question. If an applicant broke a law or got expelled from school, some universities would rescind their applications as soon as they were notified. 
              But, for some universities, there has been a grey area of what has been "acceptable". For example, are overdue library fees enough to be rescinded? What about too many detentions? Or too many abscences?
              By releasing a specific statement on "civic action" or supporting #NeverAgain marches and demonstrations, admission offices have a unique 
              opportunity to concretely say what will be right or wrong for them.</p>
            <h4 class="ui header">If some schools have already spoken out for the #NeverAgain movement, why do we need more?</h4>
              <p>High school applicants apply to several universities. Some students may not feel comfortable participating in demonstrations if not 100% of the schools they apply to come out in support of the civic actions. By calling on all universities to make statements, we put their minds to rest.</p>

          My name is Alex Garcia, I'm a third-year Computer Engineering major at UC San Diego, originally from Whittier CA.
          I made this tool because college admissions is a giant part of my life (currently work as a College
          Ambassador at my university), and I'm a frequent user of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/">r/ApplyingToCollege</a>.
          I also fully support the #NeverAgain movement, and want to see it accomplish great things in this country.
          I thought a tool like this would be useful to some people, so I made it.
