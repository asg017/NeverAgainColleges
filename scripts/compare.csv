0,Hult International Business School,"To the Hult enrollment team:  I am proud that the students at Hult International Business School are passionate, determined, open-minded, and engagedâ€”in fact, these are exactly the characteristics that we look for in applicants to our school.    We encourage our global school community to be involved in constructive activities that have a positive social impact on our world. In that spirit, Hult applicants should rest assured that their participation in peaceful protests will not negatively impact or jeopardize any offer of admission to our institution.  Kind regards  Dr Stephen Hodges President www.hult.edu"
